A system of interconnected AI agents designed to provide comprehensive financial intelligence, blockchain analytics, and ML-powered investment insights.

## üåü Project Overview

FinChain Intelligence Network (FIN) is an advanced multi-agent system that combines specialized AI agents to deliver comprehensive financial and blockchain intelligence. The system leverages machine learning, natural language processing, and blockchain technology to provide real-time analysis, personalized recommendations, and regulatory compliance guidance.

Built on Fetch.ai's uAgents framework, FIN creates a collaborative ecosystem of autonomous agents specializing in different financial and blockchain domains.

## ü§ñ Specialized AI Agents

### BlockchainAnalyst Agent
- Monitors blockchain transactions across multiple networks
- Analyzes smart contract activity and identifies potential risks
- Provides real-time alerts on suspicious transactions or market anomalies

### FinTech Navigator Agent
- Tracks fintech trends, regulations, and market movements
- Monitors financial news and interprets impact on investments
- Assists with payment systems integration and financial API orchestration

### ML Investment Strategist Agent
- Uses machine learning to predict market trends and asset performance
- Provides personalized investment recommendations based on risk profiles
- Optimizes portfolio allocation using reinforcement learning algorithms

### Crypto Economics Agent
- Models tokenomics and provides insights on token valuation
- Analyzes yield farming opportunities and DeFi protocols
- Evaluates the economic sustainability of blockchain projects

### Regulatory Compliance Agent
- Keeps track of financial and blockchain regulations across jurisdictions
- Flags compliance risks in proposed financial transactions
- Generates compliance reports for different regulatory frameworks

### FinChain Orchestrator
- Coordinates all specialized agents
- Interprets user queries and routes them to appropriate agents
- Synthesizes information from multiple agents into coherent insights
- Presents a unified interface for users to interact with the entire network

## üñ•Ô∏è Web Interface

FinChain Intelligence Network includes a user-friendly web interface built with Gradio, allowing you to interact with the system through your browser. The interface provides:

- A simple text input for your queries
- Risk profile selection for investment-related queries
- Visualizations of portfolio allocations and blockchain data
- Detailed insights and recommendations from all relevant agents
- Both human-readable and raw JSON responses

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Architecture

The system is built using:
- **Fetch.ai uAgents**: Framework for creating autonomous, communicating agents
- **LangChain/CrewAI**: Framework for orchestrating agents
- **Blockchain Integrations**: APIs for Ethereum, Solana, and other networks
- **ML Pipeline**: TensorFlow/PyTorch models for predictive analytics
- **Knowledge Base**: Specialized data sources for each agent domain
- **Web Interface**: Gradio for interactive user experience

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Required packages (see requirements.txt)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/finchain-intelligence-network.git
cd finchain-intelligence-network
```

### Deployment Options

#### 1. Using the Deployment Script

The easiest way to get started is to use the provided deployment script:

```bash
# For local deployment
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh local

# For Docker deployment
./deploy.sh docker
```

#### 2. Manual Setup

If you prefer to set things up manually:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Generate configuration file
python config.py --generate-config config/default_config.yaml

# Run the launcher to start all components
python launcher.py
```

#### 3. Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t finchain-intelligence-network .

# Run the container
docker run -p 7860:7860 finchain-intelligence-network
```

Once running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:7860` to access the web interface.

### Python API Usage

You can also use the system programmatically:

```python
from fin.orchestrator import FinChainOrchestrator
from agents.blockchain_analyst.blockchain_analyst import BlockchainAnalyst
# Import other agents as needed

# Initialize the orchestrator
orchestrator = FinChainOrchestrator()

# Create and register agents
blockchain_analyst = BlockchainAnalyst()
orchestrator.register_agent(blockchain_analyst)
# Register other agents similarly

# Ask a question
response = orchestrator.process_query("Analyze the investment potential of Ethereum DeFi projects")
print(response)
```

## üìä Use Cases

1. **Investment Due Diligence**: Comprehensive analysis of blockchain projects combining technical, economic, and regulatory perspectives.
2. **Financial Strategy Planning**: ML-powered investment advice with regulatory compliance checks and blockchain analytics.
3. **Market Intelligence**: Real-time insights combining traditional financial data with blockchain metrics.
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Assessment of compliance requirements across jurisdictions for fintech and blockchain projects.
5. **Trend Analysis**: Identification and evaluation of emerging fintech and blockchain trends.

## üõ†Ô∏è Extending the System

See [docs/extending.md](docs/extending.md) for guidance on creating new agents or enhancing existing ones. The system is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing you to:

- Create new specialized agents
- Integrate additional data sources
- Enhance existing agent capabilities
- Customize the web interface

## üîÑ Development Workflow

1. Run tests:
```bash
pytest
```

2. Format code:
```bash
black .
```

3. Run with Docker:
```bash
docker build -t finchain-intelligence-network .
docker run -p 7860:7860 finchain-intelligence-network
```
